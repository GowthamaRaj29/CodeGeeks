# Real Time Sign Language Detection with Tensorflow Object Detection and Python


**ABSTRAT:**

Efficiently bridging the gap between sign language and digital interaction, this study harnesses the power of TensorFlow Object Detection and Python to seamlessly interpret and translate real-time sign language gestures, paving the way for inclusive and accessible communication.

**INTRO**

In today's increasingly digital world, accessibility and inclusivity are paramount considerations for technological advancements. One area where these principles are particularly crucial is in facilitating communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Traditional methods of sign language interpretation often rely on human intermediaries, introducing delays and potential misinterpretations. To address this challenge, this paper presents a pioneering approach: Real-Time Sign Language Detection using TensorFlow Object Detection and Python. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this system offers a seamless and efficient means of interpreting sign language gestures in real-time, fostering greater accessibility and inclusivity in digital communication channels.
